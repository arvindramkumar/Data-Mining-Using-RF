•	A training set with 64 Variables and 2500 instances with binary response with heavy class imbalance was studied. 
•	In order to avoid loss of information, to handle the Class imbalance, Up-Sampling was preferred rather than Down-Sampling.
•	GridSearchCV was deployed to obtain the Optimal Parameters of the Random Forest. 
•	A model was developed with Test Accuracy of 85% and the balanced error rate was 20.97%
